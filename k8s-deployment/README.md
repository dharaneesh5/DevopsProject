## 📖 About This Project

This project demonstrates how to build, containerize, and deploy a simple web-based Tic Tac Toe game using modern DevOps and cloud-native tools.

You’ll learn how to:

- Build a static web app using index.html
- Package it into a Docker image
- Push the image to Docker Hub
- Deploy the app on a Kubernetes cluster using a Deployment and Service
- Expose the app externally using an Ingress resource and Ingress Controller
- Make it publicly accessible via a custom DuckDNS domain

The purpose of this project is to provide hands-on experience with containerization,
Kubernetes resource management, and external access via Ingress and DNS configuration — all crucial skills for DevOps and SRE roles.
